# NYC Taxi Trip Analysis (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes **22.3 million NYC taxi trips generating ~$395.9M in revenue** using **SQL and Power BI**. The goal was to explore trip demand patterns, identify high-performing pickup zones, and understand revenue distribution across boroughs and time periods.

The analysis focuses on uncovering **operational insights that can help improve fleet allocation, pricing strategies, and service coverage.**

# Dataset

**Source:**
NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)

**Records analyzed:**
22.3 Million taxi trips (2019)

**Key fields in dataset**

* Pickup & dropoff timestamps
* Passenger count
* Trip distance
* Fare amount
* Tip amount
* Total trip revenue

# Key Analyses Performed

## 1. Trip Demand Analysis

* Hourly trip distribution
* Peak demand hours
* Trip volume by borough
* Pickup vs dropoff patterns

## 2. Revenue Analysis

* Total revenue breakdown
* Revenue per trip
* Revenue per mile
* Revenue per borough
* Revenue by pickup zones

## 3. Location Intelligence

* Top pickup zones by revenue
* Top dropoff zones by trip volume
* Pickup → Dropoff flow analysis
* Borough-level demand distribution

## 4. Customer Behavior

* Passenger count distribution
* Tip contribution to total revenue
* Ride duration segmentation

---

# Key Insights

* The dataset contains **22.3M trips generating ~$395.9M revenue**.
* **Staten Island and Queens contribute the highest number of pickup trips.**
* A small number of zones generate **disproportionately high revenue**, indicating strong demand clusters.
* Taxi demand peaks during **morning commute and evening hours**, reflecting work travel patterns.
* Some zones generate **high trip volume but lower revenue per trip**, suggesting shorter urban rides.

If you want, I can also give you **one small addition (a “Project Architecture” section) that makes the repo look like a senior data analyst project instead of a beginner one.**
